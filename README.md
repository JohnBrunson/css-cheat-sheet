# CSS Cheatsheet

## Description

CSS is a very cool set of tools. I'm finally getting an opportunity to play with some of the more advanced pieces of it via flexbox, gradients, minor animation functions, etc. I'm building this because some of the more... esoteric parts of vanilla CSS can be a little tricky to remember. (How does that go again?) 

This project is mostly about flexbox and is definitely the star of the show, but there's also some other cool things as well in here. This is a work in progress and I expect to learn more as time permits me to work on this. The biggest thing I want to learn is how to make a nice looking responsive page that works well on mobile. No libraries, no other "helper" stuff. This is just pure CSS.

## Installation

No installation. I'll probably push this to Github pages for proper "viewing". 

## Usage

I'll probably update this with a link when I have a live version ready to go.
